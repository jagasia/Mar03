Reminder
    Encryption	(share your opinion)
	Mechanism to secure data
	Prevent unauthorized access
	change the info into another form by adding code
	changing the content to other format
	it is the process of converting human-readable plain text to incomprehensible text

	Good. 
	IMO, converting plain text into cypher text is called as encryption.
	The vice versa is called as decryption

ex:	
	we dont want the password to be visible. (It is not about masking the input control)
	the data in transit (means, the data travels from a source to destination)
	
	education		(is a plain text)	
	fevdbujpo		(this is cypher text)

	here, the encryption key is 	char+1

	what is decryption?		char-1
		fevdbujpo
		education		this is decryption

	Encryption is different from encoding. How?
		Encoding is nothing but representing a character as a number	(A=65)
		There is no secret in this.

		But in encryption, we have a secret key.

why we need encryption:
	1) while signing up, the user creates a password. That information is stored in the database.
		so it is vulnerable that anybody who has access to the database can see your password.
	2) when data is in transit, sniffers can intrude or take the data in between
	

Encryption types:
	SHA1	-	one way encryption	(means, there is no decryption key for this algorithm)

gmail

while signing up, i give a password
	password 			is my password

	qbttxpse		this is stored in the database

Everytime, you log in, you will enter "password". gmail program will encrypt it as "qbttxpse"
compare 	qbttxpse		with the database	qbttxpse
both are matching. login is success

But if i say "Forgot password", gmail will never show your old password at all. It will only allow you to reset and create a new password

now if a hacker gets into the database, he will see your password stored as "qbttxpse". But no use in seeing that password
	if he enter "qbttxpse" in the password text box, gmail as usual will encryt it to
	rcuyqtf	 this will not match qbttxpse (which is stored in the db)


public String encryptSha1(String password)
{
	//String password = "123456";
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        byte[] hashInBytes = md.digest(password.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
		// bytes to hex
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (byte b : hashInBytes) {
            sb.append(String.format("%02x", b));
        }
        //System.out.println(sb.toString());
	return sb.toString();
}

plain text:	password@123
cypher text:	2b217fd26f0506d7cfe87e08483838fe8bf130ce6b3a987d94adfd3d043454a5


    sending emails from java program

to send email from a java program, we need a "from" address
	"to" address can be anything (yahoo/gmail/anything)

the steps for sending email from a "gmail" account.
	i) Create an email address from gmail.com
	ii) enable "app" access in gmail. Because, gmail usually do not allow sending emails from gmail from apps
		a) Login to gmail
		b) Click your profile button	->Manage your google account-> Less secure app access
			Allow less secure apps: OFF	(CHANGE IT TO ON)

	iii) add a jar file
			java-mail-1.4.4.jar
		to add a jar file,
		right click project->properties-> Java build path-> Libraries
			Add external jars	(button)
		remember, the jar should be pasted in your project(bin folder) and refer to that location of jar

rEMember the employees.dat ////????

can we call it as a database?
	we were able to store employee details there. We can compare that file to one table. Employee table.

But a database can contain many tables.
	Terminology of database

	A database can contain many objects including Table.

	Table
	View
	Functions
	Procedures
	Index
	Sequence
	Trigger
	Dictionaries

Compare file system with Database		
	Database is also stored in file system
	Why they compare file system with a database???	
		A file system can store unstructured data.
		But a database is always structured data

For example
	124 A main street, Opposite to ABC showroom, 4th Sector, Mumbai

	This is an unstructured data


If there are 100 employees each having an address
	I want to know who are all coming from 4th sector,
	it is complicated to find it.

if there are 4 columns
	124A		main street, op....		4th Sector		Mumbai

We can retrieve based on condition on 3rd column

so if we store data as a paragraph, it is unstructured data. 
just compare excel sheet with MS Word

dateOfBirth is a data
age is an information

we learnt that a database is made of data files

	there may be more than 1 data file for a database

here, we need to identify some physical structure in relevence to logical structure

I say TABLE	(Logical structure)
I say data file	(Physical)

what is physical? we can see it in an operating system ie., file system

In MS Access, a database is 1 file		.mdb		.accdb file

But in oracle, it is not like 1 database has 1 file. NOT TRUE

data file contains tablespace (which is a logical representation)

Database is logical

a database can contain many tables
	what is a table?
		table is an example for Relation
	What is a relation?
		ROW - COLUMN structure

	i run a query that returns only few records from the table. This result is a Relation. (but not a table)

	Relations can have relationship

Relational Database Management System

Relational Algebra
	1970s
	by Dr. E.F.Codd
	12 rules
		every information should be stored in the database in the form of table only

DBMS became RDBMS

Data models
	how the data is represented

1) Record based logical model
2) E-R model		Entity Relationship
3) Hierarchical model			Windows File system
4) Relational model	
		represent the entities as relation
5) Network model
6) Object-oriented Data Model
7) Object Relation Model

Customer purchase Product		
	if we write the business process in english. we underline the regular nouns.

	Customer
	Product

	these nouns become Entities

	the relationship between these entities can be
		1 to M
		M to 1
		1 to 1		why not merge them into 1 Entity	ex: DepartmentHead - Department
				we can merge like	Department Table has DepartmentHead as a column
				but the problem is whenever the head is replaced by another head, we update. An 				update that causes, old data to vanish. 
				Thats why they maintain 2 tables. 
		M to M

as we discussed, M - M		relationship will become a new entity

Every entity usually become table
	sometimes, 
		A table Per Entity
		A table per entity hierarchy

DOWNLOAD 
	hr_cre
	hr_popul

from git hub 
and run in sql developer to create sample tables and data


SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES;
	here, 
		EMPLOYEES is the name of the table
		* means, all the columns 

	SELECT statement is used to retrieve records from one or more tables. In this example, we are retrieving all the records from a table called "EMPLOYEES"


TABLE
RECORD	/ TUPLE		means row in the table
COLUMN			a field in the table
CELL/DATA		one data (intersect column and row)
NULL			missing information		(NOT a space or 0 or "null" NOT THOSE 4 CHARACTERS)

		IN SOME environments, null is represented as 
		sql developer:	(null)
		live sql:	-

		they are just resemblence of null. they are not characters stored


Task:
	Display 
		employee_id
		first_name
		last_name
		salary

	from employees table.
	

Task:
	Display the same columns as of previous task,
	but only for the employees whose salary is lesser than 18000
		hint:	extend the query with a "WHERE <<condition>>"

Task:
	Display the same columns as of previous task,
	but display the records in the ascending order of last_name column
		hint:	extend the query with a "ORDER BY <<column_name>>"

	try with "desc" for descending order


SQL
	Structured Query Language
		this language is used to access the database in many ways. tHERE are sub category of SQL language

	DDL	Data Definition Language	(CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, COMMENT, RENAME)
	DML	Data Manipulation Language	(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE)
	DQL	Data Query Language		(SELECT)
	DCL	Data Control Languagae		(GRANT, REVOKE)
	TCL	Transaction Control language	(COMMIT, SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK)


DDL
	CREATE TABLE	is a DDL statement. By creating a table, you are defining the data structure that every record should follow
	
	THERE IS NO COMMIT OR ROLLBACK FOR DDL statements

Task:
	write a query to display all employees (same column list), who belong to department (60 and 100) and salary less than 10k
	hint:
		use AND, OR operators with brackets ()

-- SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
-- WHERE (DEPARTMENT_ID=60 OR DEPARTMENT_ID=100)
-- AND SALARY<10000;

SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
WHERE (DEPARTMENT_ID IN (60,100))
AND SALARY<10000;


What is meant by 
	PROJECTION
	SELECTION
	UNION
	UNION ALL
	INTERSECT
	MINUS
	DIVIDE

There are many columns in a table. But you are displaying only specific columns.
	This is called as PROJECTION

There are many records in a table. But you are displaying only specific records.
	This is called as SELECTION

For PROJECTION, columns listed in the select query
For SELECTION, WHERE condition is used

	
We query some records from a table.
we query some records from another table. we can combine those 2 results using UNION
	SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
		WHERE (DEPARTMENT_ID=30)
		AND SALARY<10000
	UNION
	SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
		WHERE (DEPARTMENT_ID IN (60,100))
		AND SALARY<10000;

UNION vs UNION ALL
	UNION combines the result of 2 select queries and display UNIQUE set of records
		If any rows are common in both query results, they are displayed only once
			so 10+5 may not always be 15 at all
	UNION ALL combines the result of 2 select queries and display all the records including duplicates
		so in UNION ALL		5 ROWS + 10 ROWS = 15 ROWS


like in any language, SQL also has operators
	Arithmetic operators
		+, -, *, /, MOD, 
	Comparison operators
		>, <, >=, <=, != (also <>)
	Logical operators
		AND OR NOT XOR
	IN, NOT IN			WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IN (30,60,100)
	BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN		WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000
	LIKE				WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%'
			in like operator,	% means 0 or more characters 
						_ means 1 character 
Task:
	Display all employees whose name starts with 'A'


	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE FIRST_NAME like 'A%'

Task:
	display all the employees who belongs to the department of Elizabeth
	
	Hint:
		use sub query

	SELECT COL1, COL2 FROM TABLE WHERE COL1=(SELECT COL FROM TABLE WHERE CONDITION)

Task:
	Display only
		EMPLOYEE_ID
		FIRST_NAME
		LAST_NAME
		MANAGER_ID
		MANAGER'S FIRST_NAME
		MANAGER'S LAST_NAME

	FROM EMPLOYEES TABLE
	(hint:	use self join)


RDBMS OPERATORS
	PROJECTION				
	SELECTION
	UNION

	INTERSECT
	MINUS

JOIN:
	whenever we need to display columns from more than 1 table, we use JOIN
	



SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 6000 AND 7000
MINUS
SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 5000 AND 6000

SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 6000 AND 7000
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 5000 AND 6000



Keys in DBMS:
-------------
P	Primary Key
R	Foreign Key
	Candidate Key
	Alternate Key
	Composite Key
U	Unique
	NOT NULL
C	Check

Primary Key:
	in employees table, employee_id is the primary key column
				EMP_EMP_ID_PK
	What is primary key?
		is a constraint that ensures that the column(s) contain unique values, and NOT NULL

	In short, a primary key is		UNIQUE+NOT NULL

Unique:
	a column defined with Unique constraint will not allow duplicates. Will it allow NULL? yes. How many NULL 		allowed?

NOT NULL:
	a column defined with NOT NULL constraint will not allow NULL (means value is mandatory)


Foreign Key:
	
	DEPARTMENT TABLE HAS RECORDS
		DEPARTMENT_ID	FROM 10, 20,...	280	
	IN EMPLOYEES TABLE, I CANNOT ENTER A DEPARTMENT_ID AS 290 BECAUSE, 290 IS NOT FOUND IN DEPARTMENTS TABLE

	THIS IS ACHIEVED BECAUSE, A foreign key for department id is added to the employees table that references Department table

	ex:
		PRODUCT table contains 5 products	P1, P2, ...P5
		IN SALES table, the product id cannot be P6	Because, there is no product P6 found in Product table
		how is it achieved?
		Add foreign key in sales table that references Product table Product Id column

	Foreign key ensures that only the values found in primary key of another table is allowed to be entered in this table
	Means, it reference another table's primary key
	Referential Integrity

FOREIGN KEY 
	allows duplicates
	allows NULL

Master table		(PRIMARY)
Details table		/	Transaction

while creating a foreign key, we are becoming dependent on the primary key table
	we use values referring to the primary key column of another table. What happens? if the table is dropped
		or records are deleted?
	we call it as Foreign Key constraints 	(While creating foreign key, we can specify)
		RESTRICT	(default)
		SET NULL
		CASCADE

	restrict means? if i delete a row in master table, that row already has child records in details table, that DELETE operation is RESTRICTED. not allowed.

CANDIDATE KEY:
	There is no constraint called candidate key.  It is just an opinion that a column is a candidate for primary key
Alternate Key:
	this is an opinion that a column can be used as an alternative for primary key
	because, sometimes, if many transactions use same column, it may overload server

Composite key:
	A primary key can be composite	(means, made up of more than 1 column together)

	invno	productid	customerid	
	1	123		c1
	1	210		c1
	1	51		c1
	1	124		c1
	2	124

	
	what is primary key in this SALES TABLE?
	solution:
		combination of invo,producti	together is a primary key

	sir, only 1 column should be a primary key no?	NO
	there is only 1 primary key allowed in a table. That primary key can be composite
		can be made of two columns

	
CREATE TABLE DUMMY3
(
	INVNO INT,
	PID INT,
	CID INT,
	CONSTRAINT pkdummy3 PRIMARY KEY(INVNO,PID)
);

SELECT COLUMN LIST
FROM TABLE1, TABLE2
WHERE CONDITION WITH SUB QUERIES
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY

SUB QUERY
	is an inner query which is usually executed first. The result of the inner query
	is used by the outer query

	in case of correlated sub query, the inner query is dependent on the outer query
	so both works together

Before lunch, we saw that requirement
	display all employees belonging to the department of 'Elizabeth'

	how we solved it?	we created a sub query that found the department_id of Elizabeth
	and that department id was used by outer query to display all the employees of that did

Rules of sub query:
	1) When a sub query returns only 1 row, then the outer query condition can use	
	=
	!=
	>
	<
	>=
	<=

operators.

	But if the sub query returns more than one row, 
	IN
	NOT IN
	>=ALL
	<=ALL
	
	>=ANY
	<=ANY
	
	2) sub query in bracket

	3) usually sub query should be in the right side of the operator

	4) single row subquery (is a sub query that uses any operator mentioned in 1st rule)
		cannot have group by	(because, group by produces 1 result per group)

	5) order by is not necessary in a sub query except in TOP n analysis
